## About Git Pages

Git Pages is a solution for hosting static web applications, eliminating the need to manage complex infrastructure. The main advantage is the simplicity in deployment and maintenance, plus it's free for open source projects.

Currently, all projects are hosted on GitHub Pages, with future plans to implement disaster recovery (DR) by replicating them on GitLab Pages.

An important consideration: to effectively use Git Pages, applications must be entirely client-side, utilizing modern browser APIs. Therefore, some projects that require backend services are not suitable for this platform.
