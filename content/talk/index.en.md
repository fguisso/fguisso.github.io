Were you at one of my talks? Need the slides? They're probably here!

These slides are part of an automated project in the pipeline, where I use [Slidev](https://sli.dev) to create presentations using Markdown. Through GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages, I make these slides available via the web, allowing me to access them from any device, including a mobile phone. If you want to understand more about the project, see the source code below:
