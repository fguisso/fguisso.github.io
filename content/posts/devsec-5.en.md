## Curiosity of the month 
  
> On July 12, 1985, a significant event in information security occurred, the "Private Sector Bust". The FBI, Secret Service, and local authorities executed seven search warrants in New Jersey, targeting Bulletin Board System (BBS) operators for alleged "complicity in computer theft". Targets included sysops of Private Sector and NJ Hack Shack BBS, and users known by pseudonyms such as Store Manager, Beowulf, and The Vampire. This event, one of the first legal efforts against cybercrime, highlighted the evolving regulatory environment around cybersecurity.
