      <description>Demonstration of how to use Github Actions to automate a Recon</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, the number of companies using CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deploy) solutions to automate the software lifecycle process (SLD) is growing. The most used tools are Jenkins, Github Actions, Gitlab CI, and so on. These tools bring the ease of automating software testing, code linters, creating releases, and final versions of the software.</p>
<p>In the security world, some companies are also already implementing static security testing (SAST) and compromised software composition testing (SCA). With each addition of code or feature, the software can now be tested before going into production.</p>
<p>The idea of working with security tools in CI/CD goes beyond the fact of automating tasks, but also of bringing the culture of information security to the teams of developers and infrastructure teams, the famous culture of DevSecOps. Very important at the moment we go through where development teams are scaling absurdly and we don&rsquo;t have security experts to accompany these teams.</p>
<p>Link for the projects repository: <a href="https://github.com/fguisso/ga-recon">https://github.com/fguisso/ga-recon</a></p>
<h2 id="use-cases-beyond-static-tests-sast-and-sca">Use cases beyond static tests (SAST and SCA)</h2>
<p>The simplest use case we can address is dynamic security tests scheduled to take place periodically, taking into account that the application is already in production.</p>
<p>Other interesting cases would be the possibility of Red Team teams, taking advantage of the event notifications of a pipeline, to launch automated tests as soon as the development of a new feature begins. I will address this topic in more depth in another article.</p>
<p>What we will explore more in this article is the recognition of applications already in production, where we will point a domain to our CI that will periodically run some recognition tools, which can be used later by security teams for future security analyses.</p>
<h2 id="github-and-github-actions">Github and Github Actions</h2>
<p>We are going to use Github to version and store our project, so go to github.com and create a new repository. Now let&rsquo;s create and edit some files, if you don&rsquo;t know how Github works, you can use the graphical interface.
Github Actions is already an enabled Github service, just put the pipeline configuration files in a folder called <code>.github/workflows</code> and all interactions and logs of this pipeline will be visible in the actions tab.</p>
<p>To facilitate the creation of pipelines, Github Actions offers Actions, which are sets of configurations and installations ready for you to use in your pipeline, without you having to worry about it. Some official Actions are available on the Github Marketplace, however, you can directly use any Action that is a repository on Github.</p>
<p>Learn more about Actions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions">here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">link</a> to the marketplace.</p>

<h3 id="amass-action">Amass Action</h3>
<p>Amass according to its official documentation:</p>
<p>The OWASP Amass project performs attack surface network mapping and external asset discovery using open-source intelligence gathering and active reconnaissance techniques.</p>
<p>Amass is a very powerful tool that provides us with functions for the recognition and also for the management of the collected information. In our case, we are going to use the Amass Action just to enumerate a domain and bring the result in a txt file for later use.</p>
<p>In your repository create a file called <code>amass.yml</code> inside the <code>.github/workflows</code> folder and add these settings and let&rsquo;s analyze what we are doing line by line:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Note: .yml/.yaml files are heavily indented, so the tabs and spaces within the file must be correct to avoid errors. You can use Github itself to validate your file or use a linter of YAML files.</p>
<p>On the first line <code>name:</code> ​​is just an identifier for your pipeline to be easily found within the Actions tab of Github.</p>
<p>After <code>on:</code> is where we can automate so that the workflow starts according to some programmed event, which can be triggered by one or more events, at the moment we choose <code>workflow_dispatch:</code> so that it is available in the Actions dashboard and we can activate any time. Towards the end, we will see how to trigger this workflow scheduled to run once a week, but you can also trigger it using Git events like trigger whenever there is a Pull Request in the development branch, trigger only when a Merge from the main branch happens.</p>
<p><code>jobs:</code> is where we can separate Actions to run in parallel, as we are using the Free version of Github Actions, we will try to always keep just one job running everything we need. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow">Job documentation link</a>.</p>
<p>The first <code>steps</code> I will summarize as just settings to compile and run the Amass tool which is developed in Golang. Usually, when you are going to use an Action, the necessary settings will be in the documentation, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>After the initial <code>steps</code>, let&rsquo;s call the Amass Action using the Action&rsquo;s Github address, <code>uses: fguisso/amass-action@main</code> and pass in some configuration inputs:</p>
<p><code>domains:</code> I will use the domain of owasp.org to be our target, you can use the domain of your application or also pass more than one domain separated by commas.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s enable <code>brute:</code> to brute force the searches found and finally pass the name of the final file <code>output: hosts.txt</code>, where we will store the results.</p>
<p>Well, so far we&rsquo;ve done the whole process of using a tool through Github Actions, but due to how an automated pipeline works, every <code>job</code> that we run, will upload a new machine and at the end of the process it is turned off and deleted, no holding no information or files created. So, we need to get our final <code>hosts.txt</code> file and save it somewhere for later reference. We have several options such as uploading the file to another machine, saving the result in the Git repository, using Github Actions we can also create and interact with Issues or Pull Requests and the most used for CI/CD services is to create an artifact of your <code>job</code>, which is what we are going to do.</p>
<p>In the last <code>step</code> we start another Action that serves to upload files for the artifacts of your workflow, just passing the name of the current file and the final name that will be available within the artifacts of this workflow.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s run our workflow manually, just go to the Actions tab of your repository, choose the Amass Enum workflow, and click on the Run Workflow button.

</p>
<p>Right after you can see your workflow running and if you want to follow the <code>steps</code> and logs, just click on your <code>job</code> <code>recon</code>.</p>
<p>Once the workflow finishes all the <code>steps</code> you will be able to see the results and your artifact will be available for download:</p>

<h3 id="naabu-action">Naabu Action</h3>
<p>Naabu is a port scan tool where it will look for the open and active ports of a given host. The creators of the project maintain an official version of a Github Actions to run Naabu, so let&rsquo;s follow their documentation to follow our recon workflow.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add the Naabu Action to port recognition from this list of domains that Amass has given us. As one depends on the result of the other, let&rsquo;s put it in the sequence of <code>steps</code> so that it will be executed right away if there is no error in the execution of the previous step.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>October is here and everyone is running after their 4 PR&rsquo;s to win a digitalocean t-shirt!</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, in October there is Hacktoberfest, an online and global event where people are awarded for contributing open source code. More information you can see on the official website of the <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">event</a>.</p>
<h1 id="owasp-and-projects">OWASP and projects!</h1>
<p>The information security crowd knows how important the tools that assist in the process of code and vulnerability analysis are, and now is the time to contribute these tools and materials.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of the most interesting OWASP projects that can help you with your work and also accept that you contribute code or documentation:</p>
<h2 id="owasp-top-10">OWASP Top 10</h2>

      <description>Algumas dicas de como montar uma boa palestra e de quebra já escrever um artigo</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="escrevendo-artigos-e-palestras">Escrevendo artigos e palestras</h1>
<p>Veja como começar a compartilhar conhecimento de umas vez por todas.</p>
<p>Se você chegou até aqui, o seu desafio é começar um artigo ou palestra logo após terminar a leitura, não me deixe desapontado.</p>
<p>Escrever artigos e palestras é uma coisa magnifica pois é um dos meios de compartilhar e descentralizar o conhecimento, o que é um dos mantras da cultura hacker que eu gosto muito de seguir.</p>
<p>A algum tempo participo e ajudo a organizar eventos de tecnologia, atualmente sou membro da equipe de conteúdos da Campus Party Brasil e responsável pelas comunidades do evento. Sendo assim eu busquei um pouco sobre como palestrar melhor e aprendi algumas coisas por ai. Inclusive fiz um curso bem legal que foi muito bom não só para palestrar, mas também para o meu auto conhecimento, recomendo muito. <a href="https://leonardocalixto.com.br/">https://leonardocalixto.com.br/</a></p>

<em>Palestra sobre phishing no LAMEC 2018</em></p>
<p>Lógico que palestrar e escrever um artigo são coisas diferentes, mas na minha mente uma boa palestra começa com um bom planejamento, que pode ser um artigo. Imagina se toda palestra já tivesse seu artigo bunitinho, o mundo seria melhor.</p>
<h3 id="storytelling">Storytelling</h3>
<p>Aqui você não vai encontrar muito sobre este assunto, então vou deixar alguns links para você se aprofundar, mas em resumo, um bom artigo ou palestra nada mais é do que uma boa historia contada.</p>
<p>E uma historia precisa de um começo, meio e fim. Por exemplo a chapeuzinho vermelho:</p>
<p>Começa com uma garota, como ela é, o que ela tem e oque ela precisa de fazer.</p>
<p>No meio, se desenvolve o que ela fez com tudo o que foi apresentado, a historia chega a dar um frio na barriga, uma curiosidade, até chegar no climax da situação.</p>
<p>Por fim tudo que foi desenvolvido no meio, chega em uma solução, tudo se encaixa e termina bem.</p>
<p>Assim deve ser o seu artigo ou palestra, você escolhe um tema, pequeno pois não quer escrever um livro e nem dar uma palestra-filme, elucida os pontos para iniciar o desenvolvimento da historia e atraia a curiosidade do leitor, depois explica cada ponto trazido no inicio, e ao fim, chega em uma conclusão.</p>
<h3 id="dicas-e-links">Dicas e links</h3>
<p>Pegue artigos e palestra com o tema parecido com seu e analise como foi construído.</p>
<p>Fale de coisas que você tenha propriedade, isso não quer dizer que se você não entende um assunto 100%, não pode falar sobre ele. Por exemplo gosto muito palestras, mas não sou formado em comunicação para estar falando aqui, acontece que mesmo assim estou compartilhando experiencias que deram certo comigo e são legais para quem esta começando e não vou alem do que eu não sei.</p>
<p>Medo, vai com medo mesmo, feedbacks são importantes, se preocupe se você só tiver recebendo feedbacks bons, talvez as pessoas não querem perder tempo discutindo com você. Se for feedback ruim, melhor ainda que você vai ter coisas para melhor e aprender coisas novas.</p>
<p>Em palestras as coisas vão muito alem de uma linha de raciocínio do storytelling, existe o tom de voz, a postura do palestrante, improviso, humor e por ai vai, técnicas de palco em geral, nada muito difícil que você não possa aprender na internet.</p>
