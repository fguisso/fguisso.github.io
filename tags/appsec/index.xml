      <description>Demonstration of how to use Github Actions to automate a Recon</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, the number of companies using CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deploy) solutions to automate the software lifecycle process (SLD) is growing. The most used tools are Jenkins, Github Actions, Gitlab CI, and so on. These tools bring the ease of automating software testing, code linters, creating releases, and final versions of the software.</p>
<p>In the security world, some companies are also already implementing static security testing (SAST) and compromised software composition testing (SCA). With each addition of code or feature, the software can now be tested before going into production.</p>
<p>The idea of working with security tools in CI/CD goes beyond the fact of automating tasks, but also of bringing the culture of information security to the teams of developers and infrastructure teams, the famous culture of DevSecOps. Very important at the moment we go through where development teams are scaling absurdly and we don&rsquo;t have security experts to accompany these teams.</p>
<p>Link for the projects repository: <a href="https://github.com/fguisso/ga-recon">https://github.com/fguisso/ga-recon</a></p>
<h2 id="use-cases-beyond-static-tests-sast-and-sca">Use cases beyond static tests (SAST and SCA)</h2>
<p>The simplest use case we can address is dynamic security tests scheduled to take place periodically, taking into account that the application is already in production.</p>
<p>Other interesting cases would be the possibility of Red Team teams, taking advantage of the event notifications of a pipeline, to launch automated tests as soon as the development of a new feature begins. I will address this topic in more depth in another article.</p>
<p>What we will explore more in this article is the recognition of applications already in production, where we will point a domain to our CI that will periodically run some recognition tools, which can be used later by security teams for future security analyses.</p>
<h2 id="github-and-github-actions">Github and Github Actions</h2>
<p>We are going to use Github to version and store our project, so go to github.com and create a new repository. Now let&rsquo;s create and edit some files, if you don&rsquo;t know how Github works, you can use the graphical interface.
Github Actions is already an enabled Github service, just put the pipeline configuration files in a folder called <code>.github/workflows</code> and all interactions and logs of this pipeline will be visible in the actions tab.</p>
<p>To facilitate the creation of pipelines, Github Actions offers Actions, which are sets of configurations and installations ready for you to use in your pipeline, without you having to worry about it. Some official Actions are available on the Github Marketplace, however, you can directly use any Action that is a repository on Github.</p>
<p>Learn more about Actions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions">here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">link</a> to the marketplace.</p>

<h3 id="amass-action">Amass Action</h3>
<p>Amass according to its official documentation:</p>
<p>The OWASP Amass project performs attack surface network mapping and external asset discovery using open-source intelligence gathering and active reconnaissance techniques.</p>
<p>Amass is a very powerful tool that provides us with functions for the recognition and also for the management of the collected information. In our case, we are going to use the Amass Action just to enumerate a domain and bring the result in a txt file for later use.</p>
<p>In your repository create a file called <code>amass.yml</code> inside the <code>.github/workflows</code> folder and add these settings and let&rsquo;s analyze what we are doing line by line:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Note: .yml/.yaml files are heavily indented, so the tabs and spaces within the file must be correct to avoid errors. You can use Github itself to validate your file or use a linter of YAML files.</p>
<p>On the first line <code>name:</code> ​​is just an identifier for your pipeline to be easily found within the Actions tab of Github.</p>
<p>After <code>on:</code> is where we can automate so that the workflow starts according to some programmed event, which can be triggered by one or more events, at the moment we choose <code>workflow_dispatch:</code> so that it is available in the Actions dashboard and we can activate any time. Towards the end, we will see how to trigger this workflow scheduled to run once a week, but you can also trigger it using Git events like trigger whenever there is a Pull Request in the development branch, trigger only when a Merge from the main branch happens.</p>
<p><code>jobs:</code> is where we can separate Actions to run in parallel, as we are using the Free version of Github Actions, we will try to always keep just one job running everything we need. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow">Job documentation link</a>.</p>
<p>The first <code>steps</code> I will summarize as just settings to compile and run the Amass tool which is developed in Golang. Usually, when you are going to use an Action, the necessary settings will be in the documentation, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>After the initial <code>steps</code>, let&rsquo;s call the Amass Action using the Action&rsquo;s Github address, <code>uses: fguisso/amass-action@main</code> and pass in some configuration inputs:</p>
<p><code>domains:</code> I will use the domain of owasp.org to be our target, you can use the domain of your application or also pass more than one domain separated by commas.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s enable <code>brute:</code> to brute force the searches found and finally pass the name of the final file <code>output: hosts.txt</code>, where we will store the results.</p>
<p>Well, so far we&rsquo;ve done the whole process of using a tool through Github Actions, but due to how an automated pipeline works, every <code>job</code> that we run, will upload a new machine and at the end of the process it is turned off and deleted, no holding no information or files created. So, we need to get our final <code>hosts.txt</code> file and save it somewhere for later reference. We have several options such as uploading the file to another machine, saving the result in the Git repository, using Github Actions we can also create and interact with Issues or Pull Requests and the most used for CI/CD services is to create an artifact of your <code>job</code>, which is what we are going to do.</p>
<p>In the last <code>step</code> we start another Action that serves to upload files for the artifacts of your workflow, just passing the name of the current file and the final name that will be available within the artifacts of this workflow.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s run our workflow manually, just go to the Actions tab of your repository, choose the Amass Enum workflow, and click on the Run Workflow button.

</p>
<p>Right after you can see your workflow running and if you want to follow the <code>steps</code> and logs, just click on your <code>job</code> <code>recon</code>.</p>
<p>Once the workflow finishes all the <code>steps</code> you will be able to see the results and your artifact will be available for download:</p>

<h3 id="naabu-action">Naabu Action</h3>
<p>Naabu is a port scan tool where it will look for the open and active ports of a given host. The creators of the project maintain an official version of a Github Actions to run Naabu, so let&rsquo;s follow their documentation to follow our recon workflow.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add the Naabu Action to port recognition from this list of domains that Amass has given us. As one depends on the result of the other, let&rsquo;s put it in the sequence of <code>steps</code> so that it will be executed right away if there is no error in the execution of the previous step.</p>

      <description>Demostração de como utilizar o Github Actions para automatizar um Recon</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Atualmente vem crescendo o número de empresas que utilizam soluções de CI(Continuous Integration) e CD(Continuous Deploy) para automatizar o processo do ciclo de vida do software(SLD). As ferramentas mais utilizadas são Jenkins, Github Actions, Gitlab CI e por aí vai. Estas ferramentas trazem a facilidade de automatizar os testes de software, linters de código, criação de releases e versões finais do software.</p>
<p>No mundo da segurança algumas empresas também já estão implementando os testes de segurança estáticos(SAST) e testes de composição de software(SCA) comprometidos. A cada adição de código ou feature, agora o software pode ser testado antes de ir para produção.</p>
<p>A ideia de trabalhar com ferramentas de segurança no CI/CD vai além do fato de automatizar tarefas, mas também de trazer a cultura de segurança da informação para os times de desenvolvedores e times de infraestrutura, a famosa cultura de DevSecOps. Muito importante no momento que passamos onde os times de desenvolvimento estão escalando absurdamente e não temos especialistas de segurança para acompanhar estes times.</p>
<h2 id="casos-de-usos-para-além-dos-testes-estáticossast-e-sca">Casos de usos para além dos testes estáticos(SAST e SCA)</h2>
<p>O caso mais simples de uso que podemos abordar é testes dinâmicos de segurança agendados para acontecer periodicamente, levando em conta que a aplicação já esteja em produção.</p>
<p>Outros casos interessantes seria a possibilidade de times de Red Team, se aproveitarem das notificações de eventos de uma pipeline, para lançar testes automatizados assim que comece o desenvolvimento de uma nova feature. Irei abordar este tema mais a fundo em outro artigo.</p>
<p>O que vamos explorar mais neste artigo é o reconhecimento de aplicação já em produção, onde vamos apontar um domínio para nosso CI que vai rodar periodicamente algumas ferramentas de reconhecimento, o que pode ser usado depois pelos times de segurança para futuras análises de segurança.</p>
<h2 id="github-e-github-actions">Github e Github Actions</h2>
<p>Vamos utilizar o Github para versionar e armazenar nosso projeto, então acesse github.com e crie um novo repositório. Agora vamos criar e editar alguns arquivos, caso você não conheça bem o funcionamento do Github, pode usar a interface gráfica mesmo.
O Github Actions já é um serviço habilitado do Github, bastando apenas que você coloque os arquivos de configuração da pipeline em uma pasta chamada <code>.github/workflows</code> e todas as interações e logs desta pipeline serão visíveis na aba actions.</p>
<p>Para facilitar a criação de pipelines, o Github Actions oferece as Actions, que são conjuntos de configurações e instalações prontas para você utilizar na sua pipeline, sem a necessidade de você se preocupar com isso. Algumas Actions oficiais estão disponíveis no Marketplace do Github, porém você pode utilizar diretamente qualquer Action que seja um repositório no Github.</p>
<p>Saiba mais sobre as Actions aqui e o link para o marketplace.</p>

<h3 id="amass-action">Amass Action</h3>
<p>Amass de acordo com sua documentação oficial:</p>
<p>O projeto OWASP Amass realiza mapeamento de rede de superfícies de ataque e descoberta de ativos externos usando coleta de informações de código aberto e técnicas de reconhecimento ativo.</p>
<p>Amass é uma ferramenta muito poderosa que nos fornece funções para o reconhecimento e também para o gerenciamento das informações coletadas. Em nosso caso, vamos utilizar o Amass Action apenas para enumerar um domínio e trazer o resultado em um arquivo txt para usar posteriormente.</p>
<p>Em seu repositório crie um arquivo chamado <code>amass.yml</code> dentro da pasta <code>.github/workflows</code> e adicione estas configurações e vamos analisar linha a linha o que estamos fazendo:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Obs: arquivos .yml/.yaml são fortemente identados, então os tabs e espaços dentro do arquivo precisam estar corretos para não acontecer erros. Você pode utilizar o próprio Github para validar seu arquivo ou utilizar um linter de arquivos YAML.</p>
<p>Na primeira linha <code>name:</code> é apenas um identificador para sua pipeline ser facilmente encontrada dentro da aba Actions do Github.</p>
<p>Depois do <code>on:</code> é onde podemos automatizar para que o workflow inicie de acordo com algum evento programado, podendo ser acionada por um ou mais eventos, no momento escolhemos <code>workflow_dispatch:</code> para que ela fique disponível no dashboard de Actions e possamos ativar a qualquer momento. Mais para o final veremos como disparar este workflow agendada para rodar 1 vez por semana, mas você também pode disparar usando eventos do Git como, disparar sempre que houver um Pull Request na branch de desenvolvimento, disparar apenas quando acontecer um Merge do branch principal.</p>
<p><code>jobs:</code> é onde podemos separar Actions para rodar em paralelo, como estamos usando a versão Free do Github Actions, vamos tentar manter sempre apenas um job executando tudo o que precisarmos. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow">Link da documentação sobre jobs</a>.</p>
<p>Os primeiros <code>steps</code> vou resumir como apenas configurações para compilar e rodar a ferramenta Amass que é desenvolvida em Golang. Geralmente quando você for usar uma Action, as configurações necessárias estarão na documentações, não se preocupe.</p>
<p>Depois dos <code>steps</code> iniciais, vamos chamar o Amass Action utilizando o endereço da Action no Github, <code>uses: fguisso/amass-action@main</code> e passar alguns inputs de configurações:</p>
<p><code>domains:</code> vou utilizar o domínio da owasp.org para ser nosso target, você pode utilizar o domínio de sua aplicação ou também passar mais de um domínio separados por vírgula.</p>
<p>Vamos habilitar o <code>brute:</code> para fazer um brute force nas pesquisas encontradas e para finalizar vamos passar o nome do arquivo final <code>output: hosts.txt</code>, onde vamos armazenar os resultados.</p>
<p>Bom, até aqui já fizemos todo o processo de utilizar uma ferramenta pelo Github Actions, mas devido ao como funciona uma pipeline automatizada, todo <code>job</code> que rodamos, vai subir uma nova máquina e no final do processo ela é desligada e deletada, não segurando nenhuma informação ou arquivos criados. Sendo assim, precisamos pegar o nosso arquivo final <code>hosts.txt</code> e salvar em algum lugar para ser consultado posteriormente. Temos várias opções como fazer o upload do arquivo para outra máquina, salvar o resultado no próprio repositório Git, utilizando o Github Actions podemos também criar e interagir com as Issues ou Pull Request e o mais utilizado para serviços de CI/CD é criar um artefato do seu <code>job</code>, que é o que vamos fazer.</p>
<p>No ultimo <code>step</code> iniciamos uma outra Action que serve para fazer o upload de arquivos para os artefatos do seu workflow, apenas bastando passar o nome do arquivo atual e qual o nome final que ficará disponível dentro dos artefatos deste workflow.</p>
<p>Agora vamos rodar nosso workflow manualmente, basta ir na aba Actions do seu repositório, escolher o workflow Amass Enum e clicar no botão Run Workflow.

</p>
<p>Logo apos você podera ver seu workflow rodando e caso queira acompanhar os <code>steps</code> e logs, é só clicar no seu <code>job</code> <code>recon</code>.</p>
<p>Assim que o workflow finalizar todos os <code>steps</code> você vai conseguir ver os resultados e seu artefato estará disponível para download:</p>

<h3 id="naabu-action">Naabu Action</h3>
<p>Naabu é uma ferramenta de scan de portas, onde ele vai procurar as portas abertas e ativas de um determinado host. Os criadores do projeto mantém uma versão oficial de uma Github Actions para rodar o Naabu, então vamos seguir a documentação deles para seguir com o nosso workflow de recon.</p>
<p>Vamos adicionar a Naabu Action para fazermos o reconhecimento das portas dessa lista de domínios que o Amass nos entregou. Como um depende do resultado do outro, vamos colocar na sequência de <code>steps</code> para que seja executado logo em seguida caso não tenha nenhum erro na execução do passo anterior.</p>

<p>Você pode acompanhar a execução do seu workflow ou apenas esperar até o ícone ficar verde, o que quer dizer que todas os <code>steps</code> aconteceram de forma correta e provavelmente você pode baixar seus resultados no campo de artefatos.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mês de outubro chegou e todo mundo está correndo atrás dos seus 4 PR’s para ganhar uma camiseta da digitalocean!</p>
<p>Para quem não sabe, no mês de outubro acontece o Hacktoberfest, um evento online e global onde as pessoas são premiadas por contribuir com código open source. Mais informações você pode ver no site oficial do <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">evento</a>.</p>
<h1 id="owasp-e-seus-projetos">OWASP e seus projetos!</h1>
<p>A galera de segurança da informação sabe o quão importante são as ferramentas que auxiliam no processo de análise de código e vulnerabilidades e agora é a hora de contribuirmos com essas ferramentas e materiais.</p>
<p>Segue uma lista com os projetos mais interessantes da OWASP que podem te ajudar no trabalho e também aceitam que você contribua com o código ou documentação:</p>
<h2 id="owasp-top-10">OWASP Top 10</h2>
<p>É um documento de conscientização para segurança de aplicações web. Ele reúne os riscos mais críticos de segurança de aplicações web. Nesta lista você pode encontrar algumas vulnerabilidades, como checar se sua aplicação não está vulnerável a elas e também algumas contramedidas. <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/Top10/issues">Github</a></p>
<h2 id="owasp-zed-attack-proxy-zap">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</h2>
<p>O ZAP é uma ferramenta de testes de vulnerabilidades popular entre profissionais de segurança e pentesters. Ele pode te ajudar no processo de encontrar e tratar vulnerabilidades em suas aplicações web. <a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/">Github</a> <a href="https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/">Extensões ZAP</a></p>
<h2 id="owasp-juice-shop-project">OWASP Juice Shop Project</h2>
<p>Como eles gostam de dizer, é provavelmente a mais moderna e sofisticada aplicação web insegura! Sim, é isso mesmo, uma aplicação insegura para você testar e aprender sobre as Top 10 vulnerabilidades, com todo um suporte de aprendizagem, livro e ferramentas para facilitar na hora de aprender. <a href="https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop">Github</a></p>
<h2 id="owasp-defectdojo">OWASP DefectDojo</h2>
